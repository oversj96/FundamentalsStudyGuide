For integers \(a\) and \(b\), define \(a\) <strong>divides</strong> \(b\).
For natural numbers \(a\) and \(b\) (or \(a\) is a <strong>divisor</strong> of \(b\), or \(b\) is a <strong> multiple</strong> of \(a\)) if and only if there is a natural number \(k\) such that \(b = ak\).
Define a proposition.
A proposition is a sentence that has exactly one truth value: true, which we denote by T, or false, which we denote by F.
